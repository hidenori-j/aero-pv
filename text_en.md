AeroService Medical Facility PV: Final Summary
(2025/06/26)

1. Project Overview

● About the Air Purifier
AeroService's "AeroSystem35 M-D" is a ceiling-embedded commercial air purification device designed specifically for medical facilities. It boasts an industry-leading maximum air flow rate of 35 m³/min and employs an electrostatic precipitation method capable of removing ultra-fine particles down to 0.01 μm. The system features a three-stage structure consisting of a pre-filter, dust collection unit, and deodorizing filter. Each component is regularly replaced, cleaned, and maintained to ensure long-term high performance.

● Key Features:
Ceiling-embedded design saves installation space and enables quiet, powerful air circulation
Electrostatic precipitation unit efficiently captures 0.01μm particles (including virus-size particles)
Installation track record in various spaces including examination rooms, waiting areas, and treatment rooms
Currently deployed in over 7,000 facilities nationwide
Proprietary HUD display visualizes operating and maintenance status (reproduced in this PV)

Purpose: Promote the <AeroSystem35 M-D> that protects indoor air environments with natural presence and reliable technology.
Duration: Main content 130s + Loop 50s = 3 min
Style: Fusion of drama (model acting) + experiment (miniature live-action) + technology & achievements (CG).

11. Shot‑by‑Shot Narrative (Extended Text Volume Version)

Purpose: To enable director, camera, lighting, and CG teams to share the same vision, each shot is described in "one paragraph" of scene description. Also used as reference when submitting test footage.

① Morning Simultaneous Startup (00:00‑00:06)

01‑A (0‑3s) Reception staff A strides forward briskly, cutting through the silence of the waiting room. Camera pans gently left→right with 24mm steadicam. The white-based clinic set avoids being too sterile by incorporating light wood texture on the floor, with ceiling line lights still off. A's white coat sleeves sway, and in the right background, the still-dark ceiling unit stands unassumingly. Only low-frequency air conditioning noise, no BGM. Creates anticipation for the audience that "something is about to begin."

01‑B (3‑4.5s) Switches to 35mm medium CU, capturing A's fingertips operating the wall touch panel. UI shows two round buttons "LIGHTS ON" and "AEROSYS ON" aligned, tapped simultaneously. Single tap sound connects tension to the next cut.

01‑C (4.5‑6s) Cut back to 24mm, rack focus. The moment the background line lights flash on, the out-of-focus unit's LED ring glows softly in cyan. HUD "SYSTEM ACTIVE" appears in rounded frame, 0.8s pulse begins. Piano pad fades in at -18 LUFS, bringing the image to life.

② Reception Preparation (00:06‑00:12)

02‑A (6‑8s) 50mm handheld captures A from waist up. Chart organizing is careful, not with white gloves but bare hands—conveying skin warmth. Background shows light blue reception panel floating from wall, unit HUD pulses rhythmically while blurred. BGM layers flute harmonics over low-register piano chords.

02‑B (8‑12s) Switch to 85mm tight shot. Camera focuses on alphabetic tags behind charts, tilts up to catch A's name tag and gentle profile. No narration, subtly picks up breathing sounds with mic to capture "quiet morning."

③ Particle Visualization (00:12‑00:19)

03‑A (12‑14s) 100mm macro slow-motion 120fps. Fine particles from 1-second smoke machine burst are backlit with ring light, creating galaxy-like sparkle. Particles drift slowly under floor heating convection. Sound nearly vacuum-quiet.

03‑B (14‑19s) 35mm slow tilt up. Over reception A's shoulder toward ceiling, cyan-glowing unit LED and HUD come into view, particles gently drawn upward. Narration "Invisible particles—but you are protected" covers, prompting audience to imagine function.

④ Parent-Child Deep Breathing (00:19‑00:26)

04‑A (19‑22s) 28mm slider lateral movement. Mother B gently places hand on child C's shoulder, both inhale deeply simultaneously. Expressions show relief. Background unit HUD rhythmic.

04‑B (22‑26s) 50mm close-up. Child's cheeks puff and smile bursts forth, mother's eyes shine. BGM subtly adds harp glissando to string pad. Narration "To air you can breathe deeply" provides emotional closure.

⑥‑⑥.5 Technical CG Block (00:26‑00:38)

CG cuts use in-house Blender PBR rendering. Charging arcs use Voronoi texture, particles in nursing white × light blue gradient. Particle size comparison cut shows square areas expanding exponentially, background grid indicates logarithmic scale.

⑦ Airflow Experiment (00:38‑00:48)

Two-room model fixed front view. Left room: purple smoke stagnates, right room: quickly drawn up. Overlays "Household unit 3 m³/min" "Aero 35 m³/min" with time bar extending right.

⑧‑⑨ Model Experiment Continuous Block (00:48‑01:05)

Floor-standing → ceiling-embedded comparison uses laser sheet to create green laminar flow, showing smoke lines spiraling up toward ceiling. Unit count comparison shows RGB sensor LEDs changing red→orange→yellow→green→blue, overhead time-lapse gradually clears space.

⑩ Maintenance (01:05‑01:32)

Dirty collection plate removal shot pre-moistened with spray to prevent dust scatter, ensuring occupational safety. Anemometer close-up shows realistic numerical changes. Inspection scene shows electronic checklist form "90 of 90 items completed" with green check. Cleaning line shows 120fps water droplet crown effect with factory-like mechanical sound and reverb for atmosphere.

⑪ Performance Record CG (01:32‑01:52)

White matte map zooms out, Kanto, Tokai, Kansai regions glow light blue. Counter numbers use F-OUT Expo easing from 0→7,000.

⑫ Clinic Closure Timer (01:52‑02:04)

Doctor G removes stethoscope, takes deep chest breath. Nurse H operates touch panel and graphical HUD switches to orange showing "2:00:00" countdown. After both exit, silent waiting room with only HUD pulsing like breathing.

⑭ Logo & Slogan (02:04‑02:10)

Brand logo appears in blank space, light blue airflow lines wrap around logo as slogan "Purity, today and tomorrow." fades in. Piano chord Fmaj7 reverb ends as blackout timing.

Loop (02:10‑03:00)

Static CG. Unit front with light airflow animation. Every 15 seconds "Quiet" "Powerful" "Professional maintenance" "7,000 facilities" copy slowly fades in. BGM minimal piano loop -15 LUFS.
