# Project Overview

## About the Air-Cleaning Unit
AeroService "AeroSystem 35 M-D" is a ceiling-mounted professional air purifier engineered for medical spaces.
Its industry-leading airflow of 35 m³/min and an electrostatic precipitator capture particles down to 0.01 µm (virus scale). A triple-layer layout (pre-filter, ESP collection plates, activated-carbon deodorizer) is regularly replaced or cleaned to keep performance stable.

### Key benefits
- Ceiling-mount saves floor space and drives a quiet, strong circulation loop
- Electrostatic collection tackles ultra-fine particles including viruses
- Widely installed in examination, waiting and treatment rooms – 7,000+ facilities to date
- Unique HUD LEDs and wall-panel UI visualize running / maintenance / timer states (replicated in this PV)

### Goal
Show the system's "quiet guardianship" and engineering credibility in a natural, story-driven 3-minute video.

### Duration
Main 130 s + Loop 50 s = 3 min

### Style
Drama (model actors) + Miniature experiments + CG technology & proof-of-performance.

# Shot 03-A: Dust Particles Macro (12-14s)

## Basic Settings
- **Duration**: 2 seconds
- **Camera**: 100mm macro lens
- **Movement**: Static macro shot
- **Resolution**: 4K
- **Frame Rate**: 120fps (slow motion)
- **Playback**: Slow motion for ethereal effect

## Scene Description
Extreme close-up macro shot capturing fine dust particles floating in air, illuminated by ring light to create a galaxy-like sparkle effect. This shot visualizes the invisible particles that the air purification system will capture, making the abstract concept tangible and beautiful.

## Visual Details
- **Subject**: Fine dust particles/microscopic debris floating in air
- **Lighting**: Ring light creating strong backlight/rim lighting
- **Effect**: Particles appear like tiny stars or galaxy sparkles
- **Background**: Deep, dark background to contrast with illuminated particles
- **Particle Movement**: Slow, graceful drift influenced by air currents

## Lighting Setup
- **Primary**: Ring light for backlight illumination
- **Effect**: Particles catch light and sparkle like stars
- **Background**: Dark/black to maximize particle visibility
- **Quality**: High contrast between bright particles and dark background

## Movement & Physics
- **Particle Motion**: Natural floating, influenced by thermal convection
- **Air Currents**: Subtle floor heating creates gentle upward drift
- **Speed**: Slow, meditative movement enhanced by 120fps capture
- **Pattern**: Random, organic particle distribution

## Audio Elements
- **Primary**: Near-silence, almost vacuum-like quiet
- **Subtle**: Very faint air movement sounds
- **BGM**: Minimal or none during this contemplative moment
- **Atmosphere**: Emphasize the stillness and purity

## Scientific Accuracy
- **Particle Types**: Realistic dust, pollen, and microscopic debris
- **Size Range**: Various particle sizes for realistic distribution
- **Behavior**: Accurate physics for particle suspension and movement
- **Density**: Realistic particle concentration for indoor environment

## Mood & Atmosphere
- **Wonder**: Beautiful visualization of the invisible
- **Contemplation**: Meditative, almost spiritual quality
- **Science**: Making the microscopic world visible
- **Transition**: Bridge between human activity and technology

## Technical Notes
- **Macro Focus**: Extremely sharp focus on particles
- **Depth of Field**: Very shallow to isolate particles
- **Exposure**: Optimized for particle visibility
- **Color Grading**: Cool tones to match clinic aesthetic
- **Particle Generation**: Use appropriate smoke/fog effects for realism
