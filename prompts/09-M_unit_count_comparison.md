# Project Overview

## About the Air-Cleaning Unit
AeroService "AeroSystem 35 M-D" is a ceiling-mounted professional air purifier engineered for medical spaces.
Its industry-leading airflow of 35 m³/min and an electrostatic precipitator capture particles down to 0.01 µm (virus scale). A triple-layer layout (pre-filter, ESP collection plates, activated-carbon deodorizer) is regularly replaced or cleaned to keep performance stable.

### Key benefits
- Ceiling-mount saves floor space and drives a quiet, strong circulation loop
- Electrostatic collection tackles ultra-fine particles including viruses
- Widely installed in examination, waiting and treatment rooms – 7,000+ facilities to date
- Unique HUD LEDs and wall-panel UI visualize running / maintenance / timer states (replicated in this PV)

### Goal
Show the system's "quiet guardianship" and engineering credibility in a natural, story-driven 3-minute video.

### Duration
Main 130 s + Loop 50 s = 3 min

### Style
Drama (model actors) + Miniature experiments + CG technology & proof-of-performance.

# Shot 09-M: Unit Count Comparison - 1 to 3 Units (57-65s)

## Basic Settings
- **Duration**: 8 seconds
- **Type**: Live-action miniature model with time-lapse
- **Resolution**: 5K (GoPro)
- **Frame Rate**: Time-lapse 60x speed
- **Camera**: Overhead view for optimal coverage visualization

## Scene Description
Expanded chamber demonstration showing the dramatic improvement when scaling from one air purification unit to three units. RGB sensor LEDs provide real-time air quality feedback, transitioning from red (poor) through orange, yellow, green, to blue (excellent) as the air clearing progresses.

## Extended Model Setup
- **Chamber**: Larger acrylic box (120×80×40 cm)
- **Configuration**: Expandable from 1 to 3 ceiling-mounted units
- **Sensors**: RGB LED sensors distributed throughout chamber
- **Monitoring**: Real-time air quality visualization
- **Scaling**: Demonstrates facility capacity planning

## Unit Configuration Sequence
1. **Single Unit**: One air purification unit operating
2. **Dual Units**: Two units working together
3. **Triple Units**: Three units for maximum coverage
4. **Performance**: Progressive improvement with each addition
5. **Completion**: Full chamber clearing with optimal configuration

## RGB Sensor System
- **Color Progression**: Red → Orange → Yellow → Green → Blue
- **Meaning**: 
  - Red: Poor air quality/high particle count
  - Orange: Improving air quality
  - Yellow: Moderate air quality  
  - Green: Good air quality
  - Blue: Excellent air quality/minimal particles
- **Distribution**: Multiple sensors throughout chamber space
- **Real-time**: Instant feedback on air quality changes

## Time-lapse Effect
- **Speed**: 60x acceleration for dramatic effect
- **Smoke Clearing**: Visible acceleration of air purification process
- **LED Changes**: Rapid color transitions showing improvement
- **Coverage**: Time-compressed demonstration of full room treatment
- **Impact**: Dramatic visualization of system scalability

## Visual Progression
1. **Initial State**: Chamber filled with smoke, all LEDs red
2. **1 Unit Active**: Gradual clearing, some LEDs begin changing
3. **2 Units Active**: Faster clearing, more LEDs improving
4. **3 Units Active**: Rapid clearing, LEDs transitioning to blue
5. **Final State**: Clear chamber, all LEDs blue
