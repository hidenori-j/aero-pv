# Project Overview

## About the Air-Cleaning Unit
AeroService "AeroSystem 35 M-D" is a ceiling-mounted professional air purifier engineered for medical spaces.
Its industry-leading airflow of 35 m³/min and an electrostatic precipitator capture particles down to 0.01 µm (virus scale). A triple-layer layout (pre-filter, ESP collection plates, activated-carbon deodorizer) is regularly replaced or cleaned to keep performance stable.

### Key benefits
- Ceiling-mount saves floor space and drives a quiet, strong circulation loop
- Electrostatic collection tackles ultra-fine particles including viruses
- Widely installed in examination, waiting and treatment rooms – 7,000+ facilities to date
- Unique HUD LEDs and wall-panel UI visualize running / maintenance / timer states (replicated in this PV)

### Goal
Show the system's "quiet guardianship" and engineering credibility in a natural, story-driven 3-minute video.

### Duration
Main 130 s + Loop 50 s = 3 min

### Style
Drama (model actors) + Miniature experiments + CG technology & proof-of-performance.

# Shot 06.5-CG: Particle Size Comparison (33-38s)

## Basic Settings
- **Duration**: 5 seconds
- **Type**: Full CG animation
- **Resolution**: 4K
- **Frame Rate**: 24fps
- **Style**: Scientific infographic animation

## Scene Description
Educational visualization comparing the relative sizes of different airborne particles using square representations where the area represents the actual size difference. This demonstrates the impressive capability of capturing virus-sized particles compared to common pollutants.

## Particle Categories
1. **Virus**: 0.01 μm (smallest square)
2. **Droplet Nucleus**: 0.1 μm (10x larger than virus)
3. **PM2.5**: 2.5 μm (fine particulate matter)
4. **Pollen**: 30 μm (largest, 3000x larger than virus)

## Visual Design
- **Background**: Clean white background
- **Scale**: Horizontal logarithmic scale bar
- **Squares**: Colored rectangles representing particle sizes
- **Labels**: Clear, scientific labeling for each particle type
- **Grid**: Background logarithmic grid for reference

## Animation Sequence
1. **Introduction**: Empty white background with scale bar
2. **Virus Square**: Tiny square appears with "Virus 0.01 μm" label
3. **Droplet Nucleus**: Larger square appears showing size relationship
4. **PM2.5**: Much larger square demonstrating size progression
5. **Pollen**: Final, dramatically larger square showing full scale
6. **Comparison**: All squares visible simultaneously for impact

## Color Coding
- **Virus**: Bright red or blue for visibility despite small size
- **Droplet Nucleus**: Orange or yellow
- **PM2.5**: Green or purple
- **Pollen**: Natural yellow/orange representing actual pollen color
- **Scale Bar**: Neutral gray with clear markings

## Mathematical Visualization
- **Square Areas**: Accurately represent size² relationships
- **Logarithmic Scale**: Shows exponential size differences
- **Proportions**: Mathematically accurate size comparisons
- **Visual Impact**: Dramatic demonstration of size range capability

## Text & Labeling
- **Font**: Clean, scientific typography (similar to Roboto)
- **Size Labels**: "0.01 μm", "0.1 μm", "2.5 μm", "30 μm"
- **Particle Names**: "Virus", "Droplet Nucleus", "PM2.5", "Pollen"
- **Scale Markers**: Logarithmic increment labels
- **Units**: Consistent micrometer (μm) notation

## Narration Support
- **Timing**: Animation synchronized with narration pacing
- **Example Text**: "ウイルスは花粉の3000分の1..." (Viruses are 1/3000th the size of pollen...)
- **Emphasis**: Visual highlights during key narration points
- **Pauses**: Strategic timing for comprehension

## Educational Impact
- **Comprehension**: Making microscopic scale relatable
- **Comparison**: Dramatic size difference visualization
- **Technology**: Demonstrating precision of 0.01μm capture capability
- **Scientific**: Accurate, educational content
- **Trust**: Building confidence in air purification effectiveness

## Technical Notes
- **Precision**: Mathematically accurate size relationships
- **Clarity**: High contrast for easy reading
- **Animation**: Smooth, professional motion graphics
- **Timing**: Paced for understanding and impact
- **Resolution**: Sharp text and graphics at 4K resolution
