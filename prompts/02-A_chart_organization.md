# Project Overview

## About the Air-Cleaning Unit
AeroService "AeroSystem 35 M-D" is a ceiling-mounted professional air purifier engineered for medical spaces.
Its industry-leading airflow of 35 m³/min and an electrostatic precipitator capture particles down to 0.01 µm (virus scale). A triple-layer layout (pre-filter, ESP collection plates, activated-carbon deodorizer) is regularly replaced or cleaned to keep performance stable.

### Key benefits
- Ceiling-mount saves floor space and drives a quiet, strong circulation loop
- Electrostatic collection tackles ultra-fine particles including viruses
- Widely installed in examination, waiting and treatment rooms – 7,000+ facilities to date
- Unique HUD LEDs and wall-panel UI visualize running / maintenance / timer states (replicated in this PV)

### Goal
Show the system's "quiet guardianship" and engineering credibility in a natural, story-driven 3-minute video.

### Duration
Main 130 s + Loop 50 s = 3 min

### Style
Drama (model actors) + Miniature experiments + CG technology & proof-of-performance.

## Scene Description
Medium shot capturing the reception staff from waist up as she carefully organizes patient charts. The scene emphasizes the human warmth and care in the medical environment, with her bare hands (not gloved) showing the personal touch in patient care preparation.

## Visual Details
- **Character**: Same female reception staff, waist-up framing
- **Activity**: Carefully arranging and organizing patient charts/files
- **Hands**: Bare hands (no gloves) to convey warmth and human touch
- **Background**: Light blue reception panel floating from wall
- **Air Unit**: Visible in background with rhythmic HUD pulsing (blurred)

## Movement & Action
- Gentle, careful movements while organizing charts
- Professional but warm demeanor
- Natural, practiced efficiency in handling patient materials
- Subtle body language conveying care and attention to detail

## Background Elements
- **Reception Panel**: Light blue color scheme, modern design
- **Air Unit HUD**: Continuously pulsing "SYSTEM ACTIVE" (out of focus)
- **Overall Environment**: Clean, organized medical workspace

## Audio Elements
- **BGM**: Piano chord foundation with flute harmonics layering
- **Sound Effects**: Soft paper rustling, gentle movement sounds
- **Ambient**: Continuing air conditioning atmosphere
- **Volume**: Background music subtle, not overwhelming

## Mood & Atmosphere
- Human warmth in technological environment
- Professional care and attention to detail
- Quiet morning preparation ritual
- Balance between efficiency and compassion
- Sense of readiness to serve patients

## Color & Lighting
- **Palette**: White base with light blue (#DCEFFF) accents
- **Temperature**: 5600K (daylight balanced)
- **Contrast**: Soft, moderate contrast
- **Skin Tone**: Natural, warm rendering

## Technical Notes
- Handheld movement should be subtle, not distracting
- Focus sharp on hands and charts
- Background elements softly blurred but still recognizable
- Natural lighting that flatters the subject
