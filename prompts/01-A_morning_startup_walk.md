# Project Overview

## About the Air-Cleaning Unit
AeroService "AeroSystem 35 M-D" is a ceiling-mounted professional air purifier engineered for medical spaces.
Its industry-leading airflow of 35 m³/min and an electrostatic precipitator capture particles down to 0.01 µm (virus scale). A triple-layer layout (pre-filter, ESP collection plates, activated-carbon deodorizer) is regularly replaced or cleaned to keep performance stable.

### Key benefits
- Ceiling-mount saves floor space and drives a quiet, strong circulation loop
- Electrostatic collection tackles ultra-fine particles including viruses
- Widely installed in examination, waiting and treatment rooms – 7,000+ facilities to date
- Unique HUD LEDs and wall-panel UI visualize running / maintenance / timer states (replicated in this PV)

### Goal
Show the system's "quiet guardianship" and engineering credibility in a natural, story-driven 3-minute video.

### Duration
Main 130 s + Loop 50 s = 3 min

### Style
Drama (model actors) + Miniature experiments + CG technology & proof-of-performance.

- White coat sleeves sway naturally with movement
- Camera follows with smooth, gentle pan motion
- No dramatic movements, everything feels calm and professional

## Audio Elements
- Only low-frequency air conditioning ambient noise
- Footsteps on medical facility flooring
- No background music yet

## Mood & Atmosphere
- Quiet anticipation of the day beginning
- Professional, clean medical environment
- Sense that "something important is about to start"
- Serene, trustworthy medical facility ambiance

## Technical Notes
- Maintain shallow depth of field
- Focus on the staff member while keeping background slightly soft
- Color temperature: 5600K (daylight balanced)
- Contrast should be moderate, not harsh
