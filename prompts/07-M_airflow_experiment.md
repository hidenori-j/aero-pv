# Project Overview

## About the Air-Cleaning Unit
AeroService "AeroSystem 35 M-D" is a ceiling-mounted professional air purifier engineered for medical spaces.
Its industry-leading airflow of 35 m³/min and an electrostatic precipitator capture particles down to 0.01 µm (virus scale). A triple-layer layout (pre-filter, ESP collection plates, activated-carbon deodorizer) is regularly replaced or cleaned to keep performance stable.

### Key benefits
- Ceiling-mount saves floor space and drives a quiet, strong circulation loop
- Electrostatic collection tackles ultra-fine particles including viruses
- Widely installed in examination, waiting and treatment rooms – 7,000+ facilities to date
- Unique HUD LEDs and wall-panel UI visualize running / maintenance / timer states (replicated in this PV)

### Goal
Show the system's "quiet guardianship" and engineering credibility in a natural, story-driven 3-minute video.

### Duration
Main 130 s + Loop 50 s = 3 min

### Style
Drama (model actors) + Miniature experiments + CG technology & proof-of-performance.

# Shot 07-M: Two-Room Airflow Experiment (38-48s)

## Basic Settings
- **Duration**: 10 seconds
- **Type**: Live-action miniature model
- **Resolution**: 4K
- **Frame Rate**: 30fps → Time remap to 200% (slow motion effect)
- **Camera**: Fixed front view

## Scene Description
Scientific demonstration using a transparent acrylic two-room model showing the dramatic difference in air clearing speed between a standard household air blower and the AeroSystem35 M-D equivalent. Purple smoke reveals airflow patterns and clearing rates.

## Model Specifications
- **Scale**: 25% of actual room size
- **Material**: 5mm transparent acrylic construction
- **Dimensions**: 100×50×35 cm divided into two chambers
- **Transparency**: Clear walls for complete visibility of airflow
- **Separation**: Clean division between left and right test chambers

## Equipment Setup
- **Left Chamber**: Household blower (3 m³/min capacity)
- **Right Chamber**: AeroSystem35 M-D scale model (35 m³/min equivalent)
- **Smoke Source**: Water-based smoke for safety and visibility
- **Fans**: 40mm fans scaled appropriately for demonstration
- **LED Status**: Mini NeoPixel LEDs showing operation status

## Visual Elements
- **Smoke**: Purple smoke filling both chambers initially
- **Airflow**: Visible smoke movement patterns
- **Left Side**: Smoke remains stagnant or clears very slowly
- **Right Side**: Smoke efficiently drawn upward and cleared
- **Comparison**: Dramatic difference in clearing speed

## On-Screen Graphics
- **Left Label**: "家庭用機 3 m³/分" (Household unit 3 m³/min)
- **Right Label**: "エアロ 35 m³/分" (Aero 35 m³/min)
- **Time Bar**: Horizontal progress bar extending rightward
- **Graph**: Real-time visualization of air clearing efficiency
- **Timer**: Elapsed time counter

## Animation Sequence
1. **Setup**: Both chambers filled with purple smoke
2. **Activation**: Both systems start simultaneously
3. **Comparison**: Left stagnates, right clears efficiently
4. **Results**: Clear visualization of performance difference
5. **Data**: Graphic overlay showing quantified results

## Scientific Accuracy
- **Airflow Physics**: Realistic smoke movement patterns
- **Scale Modeling**: Proportionally accurate air movement
- **Timing**: Realistic clearing speeds for equipment capacities
- **Visualization**: Clear demonstration of volumetric air processing

## Audio Elements
- **Background**: Subtle laboratory or technical environment sound
- **Equipment**: Quiet fan operation sounds
- **BGM**: Continuing atmospheric music
- **Narration**: Technical explanation of airflow differences

## Lighting & Photography
- **Lighting**: Even illumination for clear smoke visibility
- **Background**: Neutral laboratory setting
- **Contrast**: High contrast to emphasize smoke patterns
- **Focus**: Sharp focus throughout both chambers
- **Angle**: Optimal viewpoint for comparison demonstration

## Technical Notes
- **Time Remap**: 30fps footage slowed to 200% for dramatic effect
- **Smoke Safety**: Water-based, non-toxic smoke generation
- **LED Integration**: Consistent color scheme with project branding
- **Data Accuracy**: Realistic performance ratios between systems
- **Professional Setup**: Laboratory-quality demonstration environment
