# Project Overview

## About the Air-Cleaning Unit
AeroService "AeroSystem 35 M-D" is a ceiling-mounted professional air purifier engineered for medical spaces.
Its industry-leading airflow of 35 m³/min and an electrostatic precipitator capture particles down to 0.01 µm (virus scale). A triple-layer layout (pre-filter, ESP collection plates, activated-carbon deodorizer) is regularly replaced or cleaned to keep performance stable.

### Key benefits
- Ceiling-mount saves floor space and drives a quiet, strong circulation loop
- Electrostatic collection tackles ultra-fine particles including viruses
- Widely installed in examination, waiting and treatment rooms – 7,000+ facilities to date
- Unique HUD LEDs and wall-panel UI visualize running / maintenance / timer states (replicated in this PV)

### Goal
Show the system's "quiet guardianship" and engineering credibility in a natural, story-driven 3-minute video.

### Duration
Main 130 s + Loop 50 s = 3 min

### Style
Drama (model actors) + Miniature experiments + CG technology & proof-of-performance.

# Shot 01-C: System Activation Response (4.5-6s)

## Basic Settings
- **Duration**: 1.5 seconds
- **Camera**: 24mm wide lens, rack focus
- **Movement**: Focus pull from foreground to background
- **Resolution**: 4K
- **Frame Rate**: 24fps

## Scene Description
Wide shot showing the immediate response to the panel activation. Ceiling line lights flash on brightening the waiting room, while in the background, a previously dark ceiling-mounted air purification unit begins to glow with a soft cyan LED ring.

## Visual Details
- **Setting**: Same waiting room, now with lighting activated
- **Lighting Change**: Ceiling line lights switch from OFF to ON
- **Air Unit**: Ceiling-mounted "AeroSystem35 M-D" with LED ring
- **LED Color**: Soft cyan (#9AE8FF) glow from the unit's ring
- **HUD Display**: "SYSTEM ACTIVE" appears in rounded, semi-transparent frame

## Movement & Action
- Dramatic lighting change as ceiling lights activate
- Air purification unit LED ring smoothly illuminates
- HUD display materializes with gentle fade-in
- Room atmosphere transforms from dim to bright, welcoming

## Focus Technique
- **Start**: Shallow focus on reception area (foreground)
- **End**: Focus pulls to air purification unit (background)
- **Transition**: Smooth rack focus emphasizing the connection between panel and unit

## HUD/UI Elements
- **Text**: "SYSTEM ACTIVE"
- **Style**: Rounded rectangle, 70% transparency, 100px height
- **Color**: #9AE8FF (cyan)
- **Animation**: 0.8s pulse (opacity 70→100→70)
- **Position**: Near the air purification unit

## Audio Elements
- Subtle electrical hum as systems activate
- Piano pad begins at -18 LUFS (gentle fade-in)
- Ambient air conditioning sound becomes slightly more present
- No harsh mechanical sounds - everything smooth and refined

## Mood & Atmosphere
- Moment of technological awakening
- Seamless integration of air purification into clinic environment
- Sense of protection and care being activated
- Visual poetry of invisible technology becoming visible

## Technical Notes
- Color temperature: 5600K throughout
- Smooth transition from darker to brighter exposure
- LED glow should be realistic, not overpowering
- HUD elements need to feel integrated, not overlaid
