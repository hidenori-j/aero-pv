# Project Overview

## About the Air-Cleaning Unit
AeroService "AeroSystem 35 M-D" is a ceiling-mounted professional air purifier engineered for medical spaces.
Its industry-leading airflow of 35 m³/min and an electrostatic precipitator capture particles down to 0.01 µm (virus scale). A triple-layer layout (pre-filter, ESP collection plates, activated-carbon deodorizer) is regularly replaced or cleaned to keep performance stable.

### Key benefits
- Ceiling-mount saves floor space and drives a quiet, strong circulation loop
- Electrostatic collection tackles ultra-fine particles including viruses
- Widely installed in examination, waiting and treatment rooms – 7,000+ facilities to date
- Unique HUD LEDs and wall-panel UI visualize running / maintenance / timer states (replicated in this PV)

### Goal
Show the system's "quiet guardianship" and engineering credibility in a natural, story-driven 3-minute video.

### Duration
Main 130 s + Loop 50 s = 3 min

### Style
Drama (model actors) + Miniature experiments + CG technology & proof-of-performance.

# Shot 12-C: Countdown UI Display (117-119s)

## Basic Settings
- **Duration**: 2 seconds
- **Camera**: Over-the-shoulder view
- **Movement**: Static shot
- **Resolution**: 4K
- **Frame Rate**: 24fps

## Scene Description
Over-the-shoulder shot showing the HUD display transitioning from "SYSTEM ACTIVE" mode to "TIMER" mode with a clear countdown display of "2:00:00". This visualizes the system's autonomous operation capability.

## Visual Details
- **HUD Display**: Prominent countdown timer "2:00:00"
- **Color Change**: Transition from cyan to orange (#FFAA55)
- **Display Style**: Rounded rectangle, 70% transparency, 100px height
- **Background**: Air purification unit visible in background
- **Perspective**: Over operator's shoulder view

## HUD Display Transition
- **From**: "SYSTEM ACTIVE" in cyan (#9AE8FF)
- **To**: "TIMER 2:00:00" in orange (#FFAA55)
- **Animation**: Smooth color and text transition
- **Pulse**: 0.8s pulse animation continuing (opacity 70→100→70)
- **Professional**: Clean, medical facility appropriate display

## Timer Interface
- **Format**: "2:00:00" (hours:minutes:seconds)
- **Color**: Orange (#FFAA55) for timer mode
- **Typography**: Clear, readable digital display font
- **Position**: Near air purification unit
- **Visibility**: Clearly readable from operator position

## Technology Demonstration
- **Mode Switch**: Seamless transition to autonomous operation
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of timer activation
- **Countdown**: Real-time countdown display beginning
- **Autonomous**: System operating independently
- **Professional**: Medical facility automation standards

## Audio Elements
- **Transition**: Subtle audio confirmation of mode change
- **Timer**: Gentle countdown activation sound
- **Ambient**: Quiet evening clinic atmosphere
- **Electronic**: Professional system operation sounds
- **BGM**: Continuing peaceful background music

## Camera Perspective
- **Position**: Over operator's shoulder
- **Focus**: Sharp on HUD display
- **Depth**: Slight background blur on air unit
- **Angle**: Natural viewing perspective
- **Stability**: Perfectly steady shot

## Animation Details
- **Color Transition**: Smooth cyan to orange fade
- **Text Change**: "SYSTEM ACTIVE" → "TIMER 2:00:00"
- **Pulse Continuation**: Maintaining rhythmic pulse animation
- **Timing**: Synchronized with previous shot's panel interaction
- **Professional**: Medical equipment quality display

## Technical Notes
- **HUD Clarity**: Perfect readability of countdown display
- **Color Accuracy**: Precise orange (#FFAA55) color reproduction
- **Animation**: Smooth transition without jarring changes
- **Focus**: Sharp countdown display with appropriate background blur
- **Timing**: Precise 2-second display of timer activation
