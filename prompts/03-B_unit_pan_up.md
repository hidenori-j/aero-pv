# Project Overview

## About the Air-Cleaning Unit
AeroService "AeroSystem 35 M-D" is a ceiling-mounted professional air purifier engineered for medical spaces.
Its industry-leading airflow of 35 m³/min and an electrostatic precipitator capture particles down to 0.01 µm (virus scale). A triple-layer layout (pre-filter, ESP collection plates, activated-carbon deodorizer) is regularly replaced or cleaned to keep performance stable.

### Key benefits
- Ceiling-mount saves floor space and drives a quiet, strong circulation loop
- Electrostatic collection tackles ultra-fine particles including viruses
- Widely installed in examination, waiting and treatment rooms – 7,000+ facilities to date
- Unique HUD LEDs and wall-panel UI visualize running / maintenance / timer states (replicated in this PV)

### Goal
Show the system's "quiet guardianship" and engineering credibility in a natural, story-driven 3-minute video.

### Duration
Main 130 s + Loop 50 s = 3 min

### Style
Drama (model actors) + Miniature experiments + CG technology & proof-of-performance.

# Shot 03-B: Unit Pan Up with Particle Attraction (14-19s)

## Basic Settings
- **Duration**: 5 seconds
- **Camera**: 35mm lens
- **Movement**: Slow tilt up from particles to ceiling unit
- **Resolution**: 4K
- **Frame Rate**: 24fps

## Scene Description
Camera starts at the reception staff's shoulder level, showing floating particles, then slowly tilts up toward the ceiling to reveal the air purification unit with its cyan LED ring glowing and HUD display active. Particles appear to be gently drawn upward toward the unit, visualizing the air circulation.

## Visual Details
- **Start**: Reception staff's shoulder level, particles visible in air
- **Movement**: Smooth tilt up revealing ceiling and air unit
- **Air Unit**: AeroSystem35 M-D with glowing cyan LED ring
- **HUD**: "SYSTEM ACTIVE" display pulsing rhythmically
- **Particles**: Subtle movement upward toward the unit

## Particle Behavior
- **Direction**: Gentle upward drift toward air purification unit
- **Speed**: Slow, natural movement - not dramatic suction
- **Visibility**: Particles remain visible throughout tilt
- **Physics**: Realistic air circulation patterns
- **Quantity**: Enough to show movement, not overwhelming

## Air Unit Details
- **Design**: Ceiling-embedded AeroSystem35 M-D
- **LED Ring**: Soft cyan (#9AE8FF) glow
- **HUD Display**: Semi-transparent "SYSTEM ACTIVE" with pulse animation
- **Integration**: Seamlessly built into ceiling architecture
- **Status**: Clearly operational and monitoring

## Camera Movement
- **Start Position**: Eye level, over reception staff's shoulder
- **End Position**: Looking up at ceiling unit
- **Speed**: Slow, deliberate tilt emphasizing connection
- **Stability**: Smooth, professional camera movement
- **Focus**: Maintains sharp focus throughout movement

## Audio Elements
- **Narration**: "見えない粒子──でも守られています" (Invisible particles—but you are protected)
- **BGM**: Continuing gentle piano and atmospheric music
- **Sound Effects**: Subtle air movement, gentle hum of air circulation
- **Voice**: Professional, reassuring narrator

## Mood & Atmosphere
- **Connection**: Visual link between particles and purification
- **Protection**: Sense of invisible care and monitoring
- **Technology**: Advanced but unobtrusive air purification
- **Trust**: Reliable, constant protection
- **Elegance**: Beautiful integration of function and form

## Technical Notes
- **Exposure**: Maintain consistent exposure during tilt movement
- **Color**: Consistent cyan theme throughout
- **Particle Tracking**: Ensure particles remain visible during movement
- **HUD Animation**: Smooth 0.8s pulse animation (70→100→70% opacity)
- **Architecture**: Realistic medical facility ceiling design
